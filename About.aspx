        Certified instructor and Wave Pilates co-owner, Katie Zell, has been practicing
        and teaching Pilates for over four years. Having graduated from Stephen F. Austin
        State University in Nacogdoches, Texas with a degree in Education in 2004, Katie
        always knew that teaching was her passion! In 2005, Katie moved from Texas to Florida,
        married Danny and realized that Pilates is where her heart is. She has been blessed
        with the opportunity to work in a field where she can help others live a healthy
        lifestyle…something she has always firmly believed is the key to a happy mind! Challenging
        her clients each time they walk in the door with a method that includes thinking
        out-of-the-box, Katie loves to take each individual to a level that they never imagined
        they would experience in a Pilates studio!

    <p>
        Raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Summer didn’t move to the Sunshine State until she
        was in her early twenties. She attended USF and earned a degree in Marketing and
        Advertising. Summer worked for a few different companies, but it wasn’t until she
        injured her back (lifting weights, no less) that led her to realize where her true
        passion really was….PILATES! Summer quickly felt that she could make a difference
        in this field and felt it was right to venture out on her own. Summer is a certified
        Pilates instructor and co-owner of Wave Pilates.

        Kinesiology: Exercise Science. She has a background in dance and was a member of
        the 2005 national championship dance team at the University of Kentucky. Once Mallory
        decided to take a hiatus from dancing, she found a comfortable transition in attending
        Pilates classes. She appreciated the fluidity of the movements and the quality of
        concentration required to execute the movements correctly. Mallory decided to take
        a larger interest in the Pilates method by becoming a certified mat instructor in
        2006. Her interest in Pilates became a passion, and she felt confident embarking
        on a career as a Pilates instructor. In 2007, she received her apparatus certification.
        Mallory continues to value the benefits of Pilates, and thrives on helping her clients
        to derive those benefits in a well-structured yet personalized program of activities.
        Mallory has also been able to bring the joy of dancing back into her life by becoming
