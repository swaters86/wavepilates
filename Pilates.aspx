    <h1>What is Pilates?</h1>
        <p>
             Pilates is a system of mind-body exercise evolved from the principles of Joseph Pilates. Focusing on the core muscles, Pilates exercises teach proper breath patterns and alignment of the spine, which strengthen the deep torso muscles to help alleviate back pain and prevent injury as well as increase an individual’s flexibility and strength.  It is a challenging, yet functional form of exercise used to enhance lifelong well-being.  Pilates just might be the anti-aging tool you have been searching for!

            With a workout such as Pilates, you can be sure that you will not only have a flat tummy, but you will completely transform your body into a long, lean and muscular build.  It will give you a sense of awareness that can be taken and used in everyday life, whether you are engaging your abdominals while standing in line at the grocery store or practicing your breathing patterns as you sit in traffic.  Pilates is not just a workout, it truly is a life-changing practice.

        <p>
          All of this being said, please know that Pilates is a safe, sensible exercise system that will help you look and feel your very best. Pilates is a low impact form of exercise that can be modified for mothers currently expecting or patients in rehabilitation. No matter what your age or condition, it will work for you.
